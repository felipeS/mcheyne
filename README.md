# The M'Cheyne Plan iOS App

## Overview

"The M'Cheyne Plan" is an iOS app designed to guide users through a Bible reading plan, crafted by the Scottish minister Robert Murray M'Cheyne in the early 19th century. The app encourages users to immerse themselves in the scriptures by presenting a structured plan that leads through the Old Testament once and the New Testament and Psalms twice in a year. With flexibility and user-friendly design in mind, the app provides options for self-pacing and progress importing, among other features.

## Features

- **Self-Paced Mode**: Users can toggle the self-paced mode according to their reading speed and availability.
- **Import Progress**: Enables users to set a start date for their reading plan and import any existing progress.
- **Daily Reading Guide**: Presents a daily scripture reading passage following the M'Cheyne reading plan.
